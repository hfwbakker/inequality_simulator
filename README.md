PROJECT:
Create a script that can simulate multiple trades between x amount of people. When someone reaches 0 funds they are out. The goal is to prove that that at some point 1 person will be left with all the money.

TO DO:
-Add logic for looping over trades until all but 1 reached 0. Count loops. (e.g. while len(list) > 1: )
-Add logic for removing a trader that reached 0.
